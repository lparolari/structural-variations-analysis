# Prerequisities

We need some tools in order to let the pipeline works properly:

- _samtools_, the tool for alignments in the SAM format;
- _bwa_, the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner is a software package for mapping
  low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome;
- _igw_, the Integrative Genomics Viewer is a high-performance,
  easy-to-use, interactive tool for the visual exploration of genomic
  data;

and we also need some data:

- _Lactobacillus_casei_genome.fasta_, the fasta file for the reference genome;

* _lact_sp.read1.fastq_ and _lact_sp.read2.fastq_, the fastq file with reads for donor genome;
